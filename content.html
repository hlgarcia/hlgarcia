                    The drug problem in the Philippines has primarily been viewed as an issue of law enforcement and criminality, and the government has focused on implementing a policy of criminalization and punishment. The Philippine Drug War or also known as the “War on Drugs” is the drug policy followed by the Philippine government implemented by our President Rodrigo Duterte. The drug policy's goal is to neutralize illegal personalities nationwide. In the process of eliminating these drug addicts, this policy has violated the rights that each human should have. The police, almost daily, kill unarmed people whom they believe are suspects, and then they proceed to place guns or drugs or other illicit items at the crime to make it seem realistic.  Ever since this policy was implemented, more than 12,000 Filipino citizens have been killed either by police forces or other citizens in extrajudicial killings. Until today, there has not been another way on how we could handle the illegal drug problem. But by looking at the solutions that I have come up with, I would guarantee that this issue will be gone in no time.

                    Drugs are our get-away tickets from reality. It is a luxury that we should be embracing instead of fighting. This is why I came up with some bizarre solutions, and those are the government should legalize drugs and sell them in convenience stores, fast-food chains, and even restaurants. I know that you may think that I am insane or out of my mind, but once people finish reading my proposition, countless people will agree that this would be a great decision.

                <p>
                    Why are drugs illegal? It is difficult for me to comprehend as to why the government does not want to legalize it. Some people state that the legalization of drugs would bring crisis and chaos to our country, but I believe that they are mistaken. Making drugs legal might be the perfect solution to catching our economy before it falls. The government needs to realize how many positives could come from legalizing drugs. For instance, the number of crimes and deaths in the Philippines would drastically decrease. It is a given fact that Filipinos who are yearning for drugs will do almost anything to get them. They will steal and even kill to get drugs and money out of it. If the government would legalize drugs, the dealers would not need to threaten, beat, and even kill people for not paying enough money for the drugs. Famous personalities, who indulge themselves in drugs, will no longer have to sneak around and worry about lawsuits and magazine articles written about their drug obsession.

                    Another solution that I have in mind is selling drugs in convenience stores, fast-food chains, and even restaurants. Selling drugs would make our country a lot richer. Making drugs available to the public will only increase the number of purchases and therefore provide our economy with more money. When you think about it, the amount of Pesos spent on the ending eradication of illegal drugs each year is an extreme amount of cash. It could afford proper housing and feed an entire third world country. How can we let people, even children in third world countries, die of starvation every day when all the money they need is being spent on the prevention of people getting high.

                <p>
                    All the money made from the selling of drugs can be used to fix problems we currently do not have enough money to improve. All of our schools will be able to fund enough money for sports and extracurricular activities. More teachers will be hired and therefore students will be part of smaller class sizes receiving more one on one teaching. Also, the police department will have funding to hire more officers and squat cars. With more police officers on patrol, our entire country will become a safer place, and they can focus on real problems such as murder instead of dealing with drug abuse.

                <p>
                    Furthermore, the selling of drugs would dramatically decline the unemployment rate in the Philippines. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the unemployment rate in the Philippines as of July 2020 was estimated at around 10 percent, which is also equivalent to an estimated 4.6 million unemployed Filipinos who are 15 years old and above. If the government would allow Filipinos to sell drugs legally the unemployment rate might even become 0 percent.

                <p>
                    I am beyond a doubt that a lot of you are criticizing and addressing me on why I cannot make simpler and less absurd solutions. I have no other motives than helping my country with the social issue that I presented, illegal drugs. These solutions do not need to happen if our government will effectively solve this problem without violating human rights. I think that the government should admit drug addicts into rehabilitation or drug addiction therapies instead of murdering these people for using or selling drugs. With our economy in a desperate time of need, it seems like the government’s duty is to do whatever they can to help. That is why I made these solutions. Violence will be put to an end, and many robberies will be prevented. Jobs will be given for the homeless that were not available before, and people no longer have to fear going to jail for doing what they love. These solutions can make our country a better place.
